# Channel-Convert
I made this program over 2 days with Claude. It takes your files and deletes the empty ones that qvgmsplit always seems to produce. 
It also converts stereo files that really don't need to be stereo into mono.
Note that the zipping process can take some time, be patient.
The converter is avalable [here](https://channelconvert.pages.dev/).
