# Multi-Converter

A web-based tool for converting files. Currently features two converters:

* **File to Text Converter:**  Allows you to upload various text-based (Or non text-based) files and extract the text content, which can be copied or downloaded.
* **WAV Converter:** Processes WAV audio files to prepare them for an oscilloscope view or other applications.  It can convert stereo WAV files to mono (if stereo channels are very similar) and removes empty (silent) WAV files during processing.  Processed files are downloaded as a ZIP archive along with a processing report.

**Note:** Zipping processed files can take some time, so please be patient.

The converter is available [here](https://channelconvert.pages.dev/).
